# Hemantovision-project
Hemantovision advanced blood cell classification using transfer learning 
Hematovision is an advanced blood cell classification tool that leverages transfer learning to accurately identify and categorize blood cells from microscopic images. Here's a comparison of Hematovision's approach with other similar projects:

*Key Features of Hematovision*

- Utilizes pre-trained CNN models like ResNet50, MobileNet, or EfficientNet
- Trained on a labeled dataset of 12,500 microscopic blood cell images
- Employs techniques like data augmentation, fine-tuning of pre-trained layers, batch normalization, and dropout
- Produces fast and reliable predictions for real-world blood smear images

*Comparison with Other Projects*

- *ResNet50-based Approach*: Another project uses ResNet50 to detect and classify cell types like neutrophils and lymphocytes from microscope images, aiding faster and accurate diagnosis
- *MobileNetV2-based Approach*: A web-based application uses MobileNetV2 transfer learning model to classify blood cell images into four categories (Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil) with a simple Flask web UI for image upload and live predictions
- *EfficientNetV2-based Approach*: Although not directly compared, EfficientNetV2 has shown promise in other studies, achieving high accuracy in classifying blood cells

*Technical Details*

- *Dataset*: Hematovision uses the BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection) dataset to classify blood cells into four categories
- *Tech Stack*: Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, HTML5, Bootstrap (optional)
- *Deployment*: Localhost or Cloud Platforms (Render, Heroku, etc)
